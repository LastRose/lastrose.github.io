## HubSpot is now within the reach of even more people!
One of the HubSpot partners we work with mentioned to me that HubSpot is now offering a more affordable entry-level option. And it actually is affordable. $23/month puts it in the reach of many small businesses. It is definately something that we will start to recommend to all our clients.

## Limitations
There are limitations of course. You only get 15 pages of content and 1 blog. For many small businesses this should be fine. It also has other limitations, but they don't seem to be crippling, and most small business that would benefit from HubSpot wouldn't have an issue. 

## Advantages of HubSpot
HubSpot has a massive advantage in that it is a very reliable, stable platform. We don't have to worry about viruses, malware, updates or updates breaking things like we do with a WordPress site. 

The editor is also really well done (though to be fair the block editor has gone a long way to improve that experience for WordPress)

You also don't have to deal with SSL Certificates (though many hosts include them for free these days) or worry about email deliverability (an issue for many clients using WordPress).

## Disadvantages of HubSpot
HubSpot doesn't have the same plug-in ecosystem that WordPress enjoys. This is both a bad thing and a good thing. On the upside, you don't have all the headaches that many of those plugins have (Namely performance and security issues). On the downside it means that you don't have the same flexibility that you would have with WordPress, though a good developer can do quite a bit. 

The starter package is limited. 15 Pages might not be enough for some businesses.

E-commerce support isn't all that robust (yet). Especially with the free package. Forget having a catalog of products. With only 15 pages, you won't be able to do much (though you might be able to hack something together using the blog posts instead).

While it does support multiple languages, each translation counts towards the page limit.

## Summary
For any small business that can get by with 15 pages and a blog this is an extremely interesting option. It's one that we'll be recommending to our clients. If you need a custom HubSpot theme, get in touch.
