In a project we recently worked on, we were faced with the decision between RDFa (xHTML), Microformats(the oldest of the standards) and Microdata(html5). Â Considering that we were working in HTML5, RDFa was immediately out. Microformats was a strong contender, however ultimately, microdata won out.

## First of all what is Microdata and why is it usefull?

Microdata, Microformats and RDFa are ways of adding additional meaning to webpage so that search engines can have a better idea of what the page is about. &lt;span&gt;5143081505&lt;/span&gt; is just a bunch of numbers to a search engine (though they can reasonably guess that it is a phone number), however &lt;span itemprop="telephone"&gt;5143081505&lt;/span&gt; tells search engines that this is definately a phone number. and based on where it is can determine who that phone number belongs to (demonstrated in more detail later).

## Why did we choose Microdata?

As mentioned above, RDFa was immediately out simply because we weren't working with xHTML. After a great deal of research looking at the different solutions we initially were leaning towards Microformats, however while Microformats was good for the contact section we were working on, Microdata offered better structure for products, and since it was an HTML5 based project we thought it most appropriate to use an HTML5 solution.

## What about search engines?

We wondered initially if Microdata would perform as well in search engines, since Microformat was the older format. After looking at it closely, we discovered the Bing, Yahoo and Google have come together and offer a shared collection of schema's available at [Schema.org](http://schema.org). If Bing, Yahoo and Google are offering this information, then for sure they are using it.

## How do we use Microdata?

We find that the best way to learn how to use something is to see it in action, so we have included two different examples that you would see day to day.

## A Simple Contact Page

## A Blog Post

    <!-- a bit of controversy on this one, as time was the accepted way of doing it, and was removed from the spec in favor of a data element with microformat, and then brought back.

## So really what's the benefit?

The benefit is that when Google takes a glance at your website, rather than seeing a bunch of unrelated stuff, it see information that it can understand and easily make sense of, and could relate with other websites. It means Google doesn't have to guess as much as to what your content is, who wrote it, what or who it's about, when it was written. The blog post above for example Google would see as

<pre>Item 
  Type: http://schema.org/blogposting
  headline = The Title Of your Post 
  author 
    text = Author 
    href = http://link.to/authors/profile
  datepublished = 2011-11-07T09:00Z 
  articlesection = Category1 
  articlesection = Category2 
  articlesection = Category3 
  articlesection = Category4 
  thumbnailurl = http://link.to/post-thumbnail.png 
  about = a quick summary of the article 
  articlebody = This is the actual content of your blog 
  keywords = tag1 
  keywords = tag2 
  keywords = tag3 
  keywords = tag4 
  discussionurl 
    text = 78 user comments 
    href = http://link.to/this/page#comments
  interactioncount = 78 user comments 
  comment = Item( 1 ) 

  Item 1 
    Type: http://schema.org/usercomments
    commenttime = 2011-11-07T10:00Z 
    creator = Item( 2 ) 
    commenttext = This is a Comment! 
    replytourl 
      text = Reply 
      href = http://link.to/this/?replytocom=1#respond

  Item 2 
    Type: http://schema.org/person
    url = http://www.link.to/comment/creators/website 
    image = http://www.link.to/profile/pic 
    name = Comment Author</pre>

Although microdata is still somewhat new and still having a few growing pains every now and then, we plan on converting this blog to microdata in the near future.
