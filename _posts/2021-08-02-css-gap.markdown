## Gap for Display: flex

While we've used the gap property in grids, browser support prevented us from considering using for flexbox. That is changing as most current browsers now support it.

It really shines in dynamic layouts that use `flex-wrap: wrap;`

```css
.parent {
  padding-inline: 2rem; // To keep the container away from the edges
  display: flex;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
  gap: 2rem;
}
```

<iframe width="100%" height="300" src="//jsfiddle.net/lastrose/xuy9agwh/embedded/result/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" loading="lazy" frameborder="0"></iframe>

## That's cool but what does it actually do?
Rather than adding a margin to the child elements, you can simply add a gap property to the parent, which will add the consistant margin between each child element. It doesn't add any margin to the outside however, which is why the example includes a margin to the sides.

## Should you use it?
Browser Support isn't great yet with older versions of Safari being the biggest issue.https://caniuse.com/mdn-css_properties_gap_flex_context, that said, I would use it, as I expect adoption of new versions of Safari to be somewhat quick.
